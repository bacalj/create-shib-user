#create-shib-user

Create a new Shibboleth-friendly user for your WordPress multisite.

*Works, but...its still a work in progress*

It needs:
- Some security measures
- Validation for input
- Proper error trapping - this is a rush thing for my own use at the moment
- Error handing and success confirmation
- Cosmetics
- Configurability
